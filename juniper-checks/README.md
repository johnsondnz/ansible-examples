# Juniper Checks
* Common checks run again EX4300, SRX550 and MX5 platforms.
* Generates a report per devices in `./reports/` folder.
* default variable `report_type` is set to `'fail'` in `./group_vars/all.yml`
  * `'fail'` forces report generation to print only failures.
  * See below on how to override to all `'fail' and 'pass'`

## Depends
ansible 2.4+ (XML to JSON is broken pre-2.4)

## Variables
group_vars/all.yml `report_type: 'fail'` prints only failures

```ansible-playbook -i hosts main.yml -e "report_type='full'"```

Above example will print all 'fail' and 'pass' checks in device reports.
